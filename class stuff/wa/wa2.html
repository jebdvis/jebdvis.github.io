        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Jeb! I'm a Creative Technology and Design major with my third year at CU.</p> 
        <p>I'm interested in game development/design I'm currently learning the Godot game engine</p> 
        <p>and Blender in my free time. My favorite genre of most media is Sci-Fi with a twinge</p>
        <p>of comedy mixed in. My favorite Youtube video is <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clsJnCm5uhQ&list=LL&index=280">this video</a>.</p>
        <h2>My Goals in This Class</h2>
        <p>I hope to learn the fundamentals of html, css, and javascript that will help me</p>
        <p>build a really cool personal/portfolio website I can direct people to.</p>
