Focusing on type in graphic design, we were tasked to create a poster mailer using schedule information from the Colorado Symphony. The main challenge was to fit the large amount of text in a readable and appealing fashion that could fit on a 10\"x16\" page.",

        "description": "For the second project of ATLS 4140, we were given 2 weeks to create a game that could only utilize one button with an optional theme of under pressure. After ideating on what I could do for the game, I landed on creating a game using the mechanics seen in the Stardew Valley fishing minigame, which happens to be one of my favorite things to do in the game. Of course, it couldn't just be about fishing, so I followed our optional prompt of \"under pressure\" and went with a game where you crush things in a hydraulic press. The mechanics of the main game were created fairly early in development and felt very close to the source material. For the things to crush, I used the SoftBody2D addon for Godot which implements softbodies that are easy to work with as the engine doesn't have native 2D softbodies.",

        "description": "Working in a group of 4, we went through a design and development process using a kanban system. The process went through an initial planning period of gathering material we wanted to use as inspiration for the site, collecting colors and fonts for themeing and eventually creating a wirefram mockup of how we wanted the website to look. We then moved into developing the site, with my focus being mostly on the FAQ page layout and functionality as well as some themeing in CSS. The website is for the most part only HTML and CSS, though some accordion boxes on the FAQ page use basic JavaScript to aid in their functionality. The site can currently be found at <a href = \"https://eliasmontiel.github.io/css_project_one/main_page.html\">this site</a>.",
